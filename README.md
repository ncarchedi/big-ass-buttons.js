# big-ass-buttons.js

This is a just-for-fun project. I'll add to the collection over time as I discover great buttons in the wild that I'd like to copy (and enlarge). Right now, it's just a proof of concept, but I'd like to turn it into an npm package so the buttons become easily shareable / reusable.

To run locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:ncarchedi/big-ass-buttons.js.git
cd big-ass-buttons.js
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- Deploy website on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Separate buttons from website
- Publish npm package with buttons
- Make buttons easily customizable
- Add more buttons to the collection
- TBD
