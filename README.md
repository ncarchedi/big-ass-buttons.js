# react-big-ass-buttons

Demo: https://react-big-ass-buttons.vercel.app/

This is a just-for-fun project, so keep your expectations low. I'll add to the collection over time as I discover great buttons in the wild that I'd like to copy (and enlarge).

To run locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:ncarchedi/react-big-ass-buttons.git
cd react-big-ass-buttons
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- Separate buttons from website
- Make buttons easily customizable
- TBD
