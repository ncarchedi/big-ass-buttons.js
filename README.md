# react-big-ass-buttons

Demo (temporary website): https://react-big-ass-buttons.vercel.app/

This is a just-for-fun project. I'll add to the collection over time as I discover great buttons in the wild that I'd like to copy (and enlarge). Right now, it's just a proof of concept, but I'd like to turn it into an npm package so the buttons become easily shareable / reusable.

To run locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:ncarchedi/react-big-ass-buttons.git
cd react-big-ass-buttons
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- [x] Deploy website on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [ ] Separate buttons from website
- [ ] Publish npm package with buttons
- [ ] Make buttons easily customizable
- [ ] Add more buttons to the collection
- [ ] TBD
